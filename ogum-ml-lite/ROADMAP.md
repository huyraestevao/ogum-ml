# Ogum-ML roadmap

## 1.x maintenance

- Provide quarterly patch releases with security fixes and dependency updates.
- Track PyPI and Docker Hub download metrics to prioritize community support.
- Iterate on documentation with community-contributed tutorials.

## 2.0 vision

- **HPC integration**: distributed execution of Î¸(Ea) and simulation pipelines on
  SLURM clusters with provenance tracking.
- **Knowledge graphs**: link densification metadata with external ontologies to
  enable semantic queries and recommendation systems.
- **Collaborative workspace**: real-time multi-user editing of experiments with
  shared annotations and notebook sessions.
- **Educational portal**: publish guided lessons with auto-graded exercises and
  analytics for instructors.
- **Open model zoo**: curated repository of sintering models with reproducible
  benchmarks and dataset cards.
